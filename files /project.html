    <h1>Electric-go Kart</h1>
    <p>After achieving notable success with a combustion engine go-kart, the team shifted its focus to the burgeoning electric vehicle sector. The team successfully designed and manufactured an electric go-kart, which led them to participate in the Indian Karting Championship (IKC) Season-5. This participation marked the first instance of a team representing TIET in an electric racing event. The team's efforts were rewarded with a remarkable 3rd place finish in the electric segment, alongside receiving recognition for the best design presentation. Looking ahead, the team is determined to take part in a range of other competitions within the electric vehicle category.

      <h1>e-Tron</h1>
      <p>A solar-powered electric vehicle which was developed for EFFI cars competition, aligning with the energy optimization theme. The aim was to create a cost-effective and energy efficient green vehicle that could effectively minimize carbon emissions. The team took part in the 2016 EFFI cars event and were awarded the best design award. At present, the team is dedicated to implementing a drive-by-wire system for the vehicle, having already replaced the conventional mechanical steering with power steering. The team is now in the process of advancing to the next phase of the project.</p>

     <h1>IC Go-Kart</h1>
     <p>In 2017, the team engineered and fabricated an internal combustion go-kart powered by a combustion engine, intending to take part in the go-kart design challenge (GKDC). In this event, the team achieved an AIR of 27 out of 190 teams nationally, with 2nd best acceleration award. Following this enriching experience, the team was resolute in enhancing their outcomes. Thus, for the subsequent GKDC season, another go-kart was developed, incorporating the insights gained from the preceding event. In the next season, the team emerged as the overall runner-up of the event with various other awards and positions.</p>
